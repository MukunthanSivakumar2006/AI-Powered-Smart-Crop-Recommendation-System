# ðŸŒ¾AI-Powered-Smart-Crop-Recommendation-System â€“ 

## Project Overview
This project is part of my Edunet Foundation Internship (AICTE) under the theme **Sustainable Agriculture**. The goal is to build a machine learning-based system that recommends the most suitable crops based on environmental and soil parameters. This helps farmers make informed decisions, improving yield and efficiency.

## Week 3 Focus: Model Evaluation & Deployment

### Goals
- Evaluate the trained machine learning models.
- Compare model performance metrics.
- Finalize the best-performing model for deployment.

### Tasks Completed
1. **Model Evaluation**
   - Tested multiple ML algorithms including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.
   - Evaluated models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
   - Conducted cross-validation to ensure robustness.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Optimized key hyperparameters for better model performance.
   - Improved model accuracy by selecting the best parameters through GridSearchCV.

3. **Final Model Selection**
   - Chose the **Random Forest Classifier** as the final model due to superior accuracy and stability.

4. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Saved the trained model using `pickle` for future prediction tasks.
   - Prepared scripts to integrate the model into a web application (Flask).

5. **Documentation**
   - Summarized evaluation results with tables and charts.
   - Added clear instructions for running the model and predicting crop recommendations.

## Improvisations Done in Week 3
- Introduced cross-validation to reduce overfitting.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning for better predictive accuracy.
- Added detailed model comparison tables for clarity.
- Created modular scripts for easy deployment and future upgrades.
